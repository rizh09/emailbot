# emailbot
a  personal assistant bot to reply to emails using the Gmail API:

To run this script:

Save the script to a file, e.g., email_assistant.py.
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running pip install google-api-python-client.
Obtain the credentials.json file by following the Gmail API Python Quickstart guide (https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python).
Place the credentials.json file in the same directory as the script.
Run the script using python email_assistant.py.
The script authenticates with the Gmail API using the credentials.json file, fetches unread emails from the inbox, generates a predefined reply, and sends the reply to the sender of each email. Please note that this script is a simplified example, and you may need to customize it further based on your specific requirements and email provider.

Remember to handle sensitive information, such as the credentials.json file and email account credentials, securely.
